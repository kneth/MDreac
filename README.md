MDreac
======

Molecular Dynamics simulation coupled with chemical reactions

In the directory oldsrc you find my original MDreac software package. I developed the package
during my graduate studies, and the algorithms and results are described in my Ph.D. thesis. It
is written in Fortran-77 (with a few common extensions), and it is possible to compile it using the
f2c and fort77 packages. A parallel version is included. It is done using PVM.

A newer - and simpler - version is located in the directory src. It is written in C and was 
developed as part of a series of feature articles on multicore programming. It was published
by the Danish magazine Alt om DATA.
