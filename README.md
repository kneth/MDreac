MDreac
======

Molecular Dynamics simulation coupled with chemical reactions

In the directory oldsrc you find my original MDreac software package. I developed the package
during my graduate studies, and the algorithms and results are described in my Ph.D. thesis. It
is written in Fortran-77 (with a few common extensions), and it is possible to compile it using the
f2c and fort77 packages. A parallel version is included. It is done using PVM.
